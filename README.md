ABSTRACT

 Modern urban environments face complex challenges in traffic management and safety. The primary aim of this project is to develop an intelligent and efficient traffic 
 monitoring system capable of enhancing road safety, enforcing traffic regulations, and providing valuable insights for traffic management authorities. This project 
 introduces a comprehensive traffic monitoring and management system that leverages the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm. The system addresses critical 
 aspects of traffic control including speed estimation and vehicle counting within a single integrated pipeline. Speed estimation refers to the process of calculating the 
 velocity of vehicles in real-time as they traverse a monitored area. Speed estimation, a cornerstone of traffic monitoring, is executed using advanced optical flow and 
 tracking techniques empowered by YOLO. The system calculates vehicle speeds in real time, aiding in the identification of speed violations and the optimization of traffic
 flow. Real-time vehicle counting using YOLO is seamlessly integrated into the pipeline. The vehicle counts include incoming and outgoing provide valuable insights for traffic
 authorities, aiding in informed decisions about road capacity and congestion management. 
Our system aggregates data from diverse sources, including cameras and other relevant data streams. This integration enables a comprehensive view of traffic conditions, 
allowing for better-informed decision-making by traffic management authorities. Real-time Processing: Operating in real-time, our system provides immediate information, 
enabling rapid responses to traffic incidents, accidents, or congestion. Beyond monitoring, our system also assists in enforcing traffic regulations by identifying and 
documenting violations. This capability contributes to improved road safety by discouraging risky behavior. The potential benefits of our project are numerous, including 
reduced accidents, improved traffic flow, reduced congestion, and better-informed traffic authorities. By optimizing traffic management and safety, our system contributes 
to a higher quality of urban life.
